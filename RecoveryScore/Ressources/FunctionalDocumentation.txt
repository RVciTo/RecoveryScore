### ‚úÖ GENERAL PROJECT OVERVIEW

Athletica.OS is a SwiftUI app designed to offer:

* Daily health & recovery insights
* Workout program planning
* Self-assessment & subjective readiness
* AI-based coaching via a floating button
* Planned nutrition integration
* Apple HealthKit integration

### ‚úÖ TAB NAVIGATION STRUCTURE (MainTabView\.swift)

#### **Tab 1: DashboardView**

* Central hub aggregating daily key info
* Contains:

  * üîπ `ReadinessCard` ‚Üí Displays the Readiness Score. On tap, opens `RecoveryBiometrics` as a page within the Dashboard (with a back button). `RecoveryBiometrics` shows the Readiness Score again and biometrics like HRV, RHR, HRR, Respiratory Rate, Wrist Temp, Oxygen Saturation ‚Äî all with timestamp. Inside it, tapping ‚ÄúWhy this Readiness Score‚Äù opens the `ReadinessScoreExplanation` view.
  * üîπ `NutritionCard` ‚Üí Displays `NutritionScore`. On tap, opens `NutritionDetailView` as a page within the Dashboard (with back navigation). `NutritionDetailView` still shows the `NutritionScore` and presents day-by-day nutrition stats for the past 7 days (Kcal intake, macros, energy expenditure, etc.).
  * üîπ `WorkoutsCard` ‚Üí Displays a Perceived Exertion Score. This is calculated via a custom formula based on the last 3 days of workouts and includes RPE and duration. On tap, opens `WorkoutListView`, which shows the weekly RPE Score and a list of recent workouts with type (e.g., running, cycling), duration, time, and RPE. `WorkoutListView` is a Dashboard page with back navigation. The recent workouts data is synced from Apple Health.
  * üîπ `SelfAssessmentCard` ‚Üí Displays a Self-Assessment Score and allows user to input today‚Äôs Mood (1‚Äì5) and DOMS (0‚Äì10) per muscle group. The score is calculated from the past 7 days of mood and DOMS with recent days weighted more heavily. On tap, opens the `SelfAssessmentView` tab. There, users can review and edit the last 7 days of daily feedback including Mood and DOMS by muscle group.
  * üîπ `ProgramCard` ‚Üí Displays an Adherence Score and today‚Äôs planned sessions. On tap, opens `ProgramPlannerView`. That view shows: the current Adherence Score; all user-defined training weeks in 3 categories ‚Äî previous, current, upcoming (automatically categorized); each week spans 7 editable days; each day can contain multiple sessions. Each session includes: workout title (text), an optional link to a workout from the `WorkoutListView`, a notes field (text), and an adherence % score. Users can edit, delete, and add sessions, and also edit, duplicate, or delete entire weeks. The date range of weeks is editable (e.g., July 21‚Äì28). The Adherence Score is calculated as the average of adherence % values and displayed both in the Dashboard and in the Program view.

#### **Tab 2: ProgramPlannerView**

* Displays user-defined training weeks in 3 dynamic categories: previous, current, upcoming
* Each week spans 7 editable days; each day can include 0 or multiple sessions
* Sessions are shown using `SessionCardView` and editable directly
* Each session contains: a workout title (text), a workout detail (text), an optional linked workout (from Workout List), a notes field, and an adherence percentage
* Users can edit, delete, and add sessions; and edit, duplicate, or delete full weeks
* Weeks also include an selectable date range (e.g., July 21‚Äì28), always from Monday to Sunday
* The overall Adherence Score is calculated as the average of all adherence values and displayed at the top of this tab and in the Dashboard
* Deep dive per week is handled via `ProgramWeekDetailView`

#### **Tab 3: SelfAssessmentView**

* Displays the calculated Self-Assessment Score based on the past 7 days of Mood and DOMS per muscle group
* Mood is rated 1‚Äì5; DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) is rated 0‚Äì10 across 10 muscle groups
* Latest days are weighted more heavily in the scoring formula
* Users can view and edit mood and DOMS values for each day
* Score explanation is provided via pop-up info dialog

#### **Tab 4: AccountView (MVP Placeholder)**

Centralized profile and app settings area. MVP includes:

1. **User Profile**

   * Name
   * Email / Apple ID (if connected)
   * Date of birth
   * Gender
   * Unit preferences (metric/imperial)
   * Health data permissions overview

2. **Personal Health Data** (from iOS Health)

   * Height
   * Weight
   * Body fat % (if available)
   * Waist / hip / chest measurements

3. **High-Level Goals**

   * Simple text input field
     *e.g., "Build endurance", "Improve sleep", etc.*

4. **Self-Assessed Strengths**

   * Text input
     *e.g., "Strong legs, good endurance"*

5. **Self-Assessed Weaknesses**

   * Text input
     *e.g., "Tight hips, low upper body strength"*

6. **Training Environment**

   * **Available Equipment**
     *e.g., "Kettlebells, pull-up bar, yoga mat"*
   * **Location Access**
     *e.g., "Gym 15 min away, pool 20 min away"*
   * **Schedule Constraints**
     *e.g., "Gym access on Tues/Thurs, pool only Wed lunch"*

7. **Settings**

   * Linked services (Apple Health, Fitness)
   * Notification preferences
   * Privacy & permissions
   * Subscription info (if applicable)
   * Log out

### ‚úÖ DASHBOARD COMPONENTS

#### ‚úÖ `DashboardView` binds:

* All `@Binding` values from `MainTabView` for HealthKit metrics

#### ‚úÖ Contains Cards:

* `ReadinessCard` ‚Üí Shows readinessScore and opens full biometrics view
* `WorkoutsCard` ‚Üí Displays Perceived Exertion Score using synced Apple Health workouts and opens `WorkoutListView`
* `NutritionCard` ‚Üí Uses mock nutrition data (kcal, macros) over last 7 days and opens `NutritionDetailView`
* `SelfAssessmentCard` ‚Üí Displays today‚Äôs inputs, uses shared model from full `SelfAssessmentView`
* `ProgramCard` ‚Üí Shows only today‚Äôs scheduled sessions and opens `ProgramPlannerView`

---

### ‚úÖ MODELS

#### ‚úÖ `WorkoutSummary`

* Used in `WorkoutsCard`, mock data via `MockWorkoutData.swift`

#### ‚úÖ `ProgramSession` / `ProgramWeek`

* Defines structure for training blocks

#### ‚úÖ `DailyFeedback`, `MuscleGroup`

* Used in Self-Assessment
* Captures subjective inputs

---

### ‚úÖ OTHER VIEWS

#### üî∏ `AIAssistantView`

* Triggered via floating coach button
* No major detail yet

#### üî∏ `ReadinessScoreExplanation`

* Full readiness breakdown view (HRV, RHR, HRR, etc.)

---

### ‚ùì PENDING / MISSING

* `AccountView`: Empty placeholder
* All HealthKit authorization/request logic location not yet finalized, some are here already (recovery metrics and recent workouts are done)
* Real HealthKit nutrition data integration (currently mocked)
* Consistency between card views and their detailed counterparts
* Some UI behaviors (like program duplication/edit/delete) are stubs
* User Management
* Database
* Etc.
